# Final Project - Eck Lawn Care (INF651)

## Description
This website represents one a lawn company might have, and it is based on a business I actually ran. It lists services, accepts reviews, displays a gallery, etc.

## Getting Started

### Viewing the Website
Download the repository, open the respository in VS Code, and view using Live Server.

### Cool Features
* Sort services based on name and price.
* Leaving a review using Firebase Firestore as the database.
